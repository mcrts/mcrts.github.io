## Hello There !

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

Hi, I'm Martin, a researcher in the field of natural language processing at the [German Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/en/web), in the [Speech and Language Technology](https://www.dfki.de/web/forschung/forschungsbereiche/speech-and-language-technology) research group located in Berlin. I work on large language models. Previously, I was a machine learning engineer in the retail industry. I graduated in 2021 from the Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers in Paris with an engineering degree in Computer Science Modelization and Optimization.

## Research Interest

I study the inner workings of deep learning models, I am trying to answer questions like "What's attention ?" and hopefully improve model efficiency.
I am interrested in all things machine learning and their applications to natural language processing:
* Probabilistic Modelling
* Energy-Based Models
* Natural Language Processing
* Information Retrieval
